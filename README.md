# COVID-Prediction

This project predicts the spread of COVID-19 in India. Most of pandemics follow an exponential curve during the initial spread and eventually flatten out. The current models are thus based on an exponential fit and logistic regression for short term and long-term predictions, respectively. Further, Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartment model is used to include considerations for susceptible, Infectious, and recovered or deceased individuals.
To add to the academic understanding of corona prediction, this project will focus exclusively on predicting the daily numbers of patients. The project will also analyze the accuracies of these predictions.
